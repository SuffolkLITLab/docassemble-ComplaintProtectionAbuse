  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Complaint_for_protection_from_abuse
continue button field: complaint_protection_abuse_intro
question: |
  Complaint for protection from abuse
subquestion: |
  **If you are in danger right now, call 911.**

  Please make sure you are in a safe place. The process to complete this complaint for protection from abuse form can take up to 1 and 1/2 hours to answer all the questions.

  A complaint can help to protect you or a minor from an abusive partner, a family member, or someone in your household. It can also order the abusive person to do things like pay a compensation amount or child support.
  
  If the abusive person does not obey the order, they “violate” it. It is a crime and the police can arrest them.
